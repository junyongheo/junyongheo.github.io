Hello. My name is Junyong Heo (허준용)

Currently a master's student in Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - Universiteit van Amsterdam joint programme. I quite enjoy computer science. Broadly speaking, my interests are in the systems fields, and I find compilers and interpreters very fascinating.

I previously received my BSc in Computer Science and BA in English Language and Literature (focusing on Linguistics) from Yonsei University in South Korea. 

My interests and hobbies include:

<ul>
	<li> Cooking and Eating </li>
	<li> Linguistics </li>
	<li> Rugby (mostly watching nowadays) </li>
	<li> Not-So-Retro Video Games </li>
</ul>
